= RELEASE HISTORY

== 1.2 / 2010-02-17

By request of a few users this release adds additional formats,
allowing notes to be sorted by filename as well a label. In addition,
paths can now be excluded from the search. To implement these changes
it was necessary to makes some signifficant under-the-hood adjustments,
and this required making some adjustments to the design of the templates.
If are using any of your own custom templates you will have to make
adjustments accordingly --which basically entails exchanging +notes.each+
for +notes.by_label_file.each+. Also, the serialization formats have
changed accordingly to match the improved underlying model.

Changes:

* Improved underlying model by adding a Note class.
* Add new formats and rename a couple old formats.
* Add --exclude and --ignore options.


== 1.1 / 2010-02-06

This relase primarily adjusts the way output it rendered
underthehood. Serialization formats are rendered as
before but markup formats now use Erb. In the process
two new serialization formats have been added: soap and xoxo.

Also, this release renames the lib/plugin directory to
lib/plugins (plural) per the new convention of the latest
Plugin gem. This only matters to Syckle users.

Changes:

* Add Soap and XOXO formats.
* Add actual --output option.
* Move lib/plugin to lib/plugins.


== 1.0 / 2009-10-25

This relase adds support for arbitrary note labels.
Any all-caps word followed by a colon will be
picked-up. Common labels like TODO and FIXME are
recognized  without the trailing ':'.

Changes:

* Added support for arbitrary labels.


== 0.9 / 2009-10-10

This release adds a syckle plugin and improves output.

Changes:

* Add syckle plugin, based on old Notes plugin.
* Improved HTML output (</div> tag should have been </ol>).
* If output not specified, sends rdoc to stdout.
* If no paths specified, will scan '**/*.rb'


== 0.8 / 2009-10-09

This is the initial release of DNote. DNote is a spin-off
of a Syckle (formerlly Reap) plugin which scans source
code and compiles a list of developer notes.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
